# JS Debugging
<br/>

On average, developers spend more time debugging than actually writing the code, this holds especially when refactoring a codebase or fixing any issue. 
This is what w3schools has to say about bugs:
> Errors can (will) happen, every time you write some new computer code.

Every language has its own set of methods and tools to debug the code, but things like logging and adding breakpoints are common across all. In JavaScript too, we have these features available with `console.log()` and `debugger` which solves almost all of our issues, but there are different options available for us to make the debugging process more convenient.
