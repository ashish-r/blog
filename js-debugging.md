# JS Debugging
<br/>

On average at least 50% of the developer's time is spent on debugging, this even goes up in case of refactoring or fixing bugs. This is what w3schools has to say about bugs:

Every language has its own set of methods and tools to debug the code, but things like logging and adding breakpoints are common across all. In JavaScript too, we have these features available with `console.log()` and `debugger` which solves almost all of our issues, but there are different options available for us to make the debugging process more convenient.
